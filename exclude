# This file retricts what goes into the tarball we sideload onto training
# machines.

# The ./vm/hosts/playground directory is for testing Vagrantfiles.  These
# machines will be moved to a more appropriate location when they are ready
# but, for now, we don't want them in the tarball.
./vm/hosts/playground

# To keep the tarball small, we only want to include the Vagrantfile config
# for each machine.  The .vagrant file in each host directory is created when
# "vagrant up" is run so it doesn't need to be included.
./vm/hosts/*/.vagrant
