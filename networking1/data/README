This folder is mounted as a shared folder within the VMs and can be used for sharing data between them.  The
make file is used to setup the vagrant user in a VM when building the vagrant base boxes and the vagrant.pub
file is the vagrant user's public key (the private key is in ../keys).  There are security implications to
having an admin account able to login without a password and you may want to have vagrant disable itself after
the first run.
