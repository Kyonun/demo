Networking 1
============

This project automates building all the VMs needed for use with GNS3 for 
exercises 1 through 14 of the Networking 1 class.  The VMs will be created,
configured, and then shutdown.  When working with GNS3, always start the VMs
from within GNS3 and never from the VirtualBox GUI.

Prerequisites
=============
The ./data directory must contain vagrant.pub, the public key (or a link to it)
matching the private key vagrant will use to ssh to the VMs when configuring
them.  Additionally, some of the exercises use Wireshark which must be
installed on the host and its path configured in GNS3.  All other prerequisites
are handled by the vagrantbox project.

Creating the VMs
================
Creating the VMs is as simple as running "vagrant up" and having patience.

Enjoy!
