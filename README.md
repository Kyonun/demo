# demo
This project provides configuration files for building a handful of CentOS 7 VirtualBox VMs on Mac OSX for the purpose of preparing for the RHCSA/RHCE exams.

Note: Configuration files for the defunct FTLP networking and security classes were removed 4/2.  The last configuration with these directories was tagged "pre-FTLP_removal".
