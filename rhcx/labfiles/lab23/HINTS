- The showmount command gets its info by talking to a process on the NFS 
  server called rpcbind (aka portmapper)
- rpcbind replies to showmount with a list of various service and the ports
  they are running on
- Running "rpcinfo -p" on the NFS server may be insightful
- If the text of the error looks like it changed, you may have gotten past
  one hurdle to be confronted with another, even if the text of the error
  is roughly the same
