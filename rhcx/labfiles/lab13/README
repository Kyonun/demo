LAB 05: Password-less SSH

=== SETUP
DO NOT LOOK AT server2-labsetup.yml AS IT CONTAINS SPOILERS.
Log into server2 as the root user and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab05/server2-labsetup.yml

The lab is now configured.

=== OBJECTIVE
Login to server1 as the user, "user".  In this lab, you would like to create a
key pair so you can log into server2 without a password.  Along the way, you
may encounter problems.  Troubleshoot any issues until you can login to server2
without a password.
