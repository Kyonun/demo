=== LAB 20: Installing a system using kickstart
OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will practice using a kickstart file to configure a host 
during installation.

SETUP
You can either reinstall on top of one of your existing VMs or, if you would
rather, you can spin up a forth VM just for testing installs with:
  vagrant up testnetinstall

You will also need a kickstart file hosted on a web server somewhere.  You 
can use GitHub for this since it is a good idea to have your kickstart files
checked into version control anyway.  If you use GitHub, remember you need to
access the kickstart file from
  http://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/master/<path>

STEPS
1.  Mount the DVD ISO image on the VM you plan to reinstall.
2.  Boot the VM and interrupt the installer to specify the kickstart URL
3.  Profit!
