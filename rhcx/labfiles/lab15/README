LAB 15: Add storage space for data

=== SETUP
On the host machine (not in a VM) run:

  vagrant halt server2
  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab15/host-labsetup.yml

This playbook will add a second hard drive to server2.

The lab is now configured.

=== OBJECTIVE
Use the second disk to create a logical volume formated within a new volume
group. Mount this new file system to /data and ensure this survives a reboot.
