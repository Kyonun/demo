=== RHCSA Practice
SETUP
This is a practice exam that provides a couple of VMs and a scenario that
requires practical knowledge similar to what is required to pass the RHCSA.

  Host OS:
    Run ./setup.sh in the current directory to create two new VMs that
    will run on their own NAT networks.  They will not interact with the VMs
    we have been using in our other labs (labipa, server1 and server2) but you
    may want to shut them down so you have more available RAM.

SCENARIO
You have two networks and each of these networks has a server.  Configure the
servers with the network settings shown below such that, after rebooting both
servers, they are able to ping each other and you can ssh between them as root
without a password.  The gateway between the networks and DNS server has
already been configured so you just have to focus on the two servers.

hostname: rhcsa1.example.com
IP: 192.168.5.100/24
Gateway: 192.168.5.254
DNS: 192.168.5.1

hostname: rhcsa2.example.com
IP: 172.16.2.100/24
Gateway: 172.16.2.254
DNS: 192.168.5.1

- Configure each server with the network settings above, including the
  hostname, such that the settings will persist after a reboot
- Ensure you can ssh between the servers, in both directions, without using
  a password
