You can use these files to setup a buildhost for the demouser project.

Run:

  ansible-playbook -i inventory.local --ask-become-pass demouser.yml

Alternatively, if this is a new install and you want to download the Ubuntu
ISO file later, you can run:

  ansible-playbook -i inventory.local --skip "get-iso"\
    --ask-become-pass demouser.yml
